  <p>So that brings down the curtains on this one. The other game between MI and RR has already started. You can hop
    tabs to follow that one. Time for me now to escape. But you guys keep coming back here for more. See you another
    day. Bye</p>
  <p>
    <b>Devon Conway | Player of the Match:</b> As I said at the innings break, we felt that it is a bit slow when you
    hit the
    wicket but to be fair it was a good wicket. We felt that 200 was a very competitive score. Disappointed that we lost
    that one. It is never easy. It is about keeping things simple, sticking to my process and not to complicate things.
    In T20s it can be up and down. I try to work as close as I can with Mike Hussey who is very experienced not only for
    Australia but also for CSK, he has played a lot of cricket here, along with the other players. I enjoy batting with
    Ruturaj and Ajinkya has got a lot of experience. When you build partnerships, it helps.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Shikhar Dhawan | PBKS captain:</b> It feels very very special. Beating Chennai in Chennai is a very big thing.
    Very very
    pleased and that shows the great character of our side, leaving that loss behind and coming up with a fresh mindset.
    I was very happy with the way our bowlers bowled, we got them at the right score. They have been very consistent. As
    a captain we wanted them to play more overs, Liam has got his touch back and would want him to bat more overs. Good
    signs that all are playing well.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Sikandar Raza:</b> Everytime you win a match for your team it's a good feeling. I was just looking at a lot of
    arms
    being raised in the dressing room (discussion with umpires before final ball). No idea. Maybe it was about retiring
    one of the guys. I don't know. We said we were one boundary away from run a ball (in the final over), and if we
    can't get that, we'll run well. That over where Livi took charge and took 20 off one over, that changed momentum.
    When I went, I just wanted to run as hard as I can. I was trying to hit a six but wasn't succeeding.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>MS Dhoni | CSK captain:</b>We need to be prepared as to what is to be done. The last few overs when we were
    batting, we
    could have gotten 10-15 more. Our bowling needed some cushion. The slower one did grip. Our batters have been
    putting runs consistently. I think 200 was par but we bowled two bad overs. We know the conditions well. We didn't
    bowl well. You didn't want to get hit to that side. You need to see what is the problem. The execution or the plan.
    Pathirana bowled really well. The first six overs we can do better. What lines to bowl.
  </p>
